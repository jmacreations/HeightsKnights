- On the welcome scree, A Create Room button in the top right of the window that asks for the players name them goes on to game type selection to start creating a room. As only the host would need to do this step it can be in the top corner.

- Once in the lobby, add a share link button to make it easy to share a link that prefills the "room code" portion of the welcome screen, the player would only have to enter a name and press join becuase the room code is filled from the URL parameter. The join link share button should take the server URL/IP and add the join code for that room.
